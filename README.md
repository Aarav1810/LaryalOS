##LARYALOS

LaryalOS is an operating system created by Safal Aryal and Aarav
Lodha to improve our programming skills. To compile this OS, you
need to clone and install a <a href="https://github.com/rm-hull/barebones-toolchain">GCC cross compiler</a>
and build as shown in the instructions on the link, preferrably
on a Unix-like system. Then, you run the 3 commands listed in <code>build.sh</code>
and use <code>qemu-system-i386 -kernel myos.bin</code>. You've got it!
